## Live Preview and download

Let's update the way the we preview and download the content.

There should be 4 tabs to view the main content at the bottom of the app:

Arrange - This is the current view that allows you to rearrange the nodes on the tree.
Text - This will display the textual representation of the tree. It features a download button that allows you to download the textual representation.
JSON - This will display the JSON representation of the tree. It features a download button that allows you to download the JSON representation.
XML - This will display the XML representation of the tree. It features a download button that allows you to download the XML representation.

Switchin between them works similar to the switching between Edit and Preview for the Add Comment section.

## Add Comment section

Let's enhance this with: the ability to define a user id. (uses current algorithm if blank)

Ability to upload, view, and remove attachments before postiong. Images are rendered if the attachment is an image.
