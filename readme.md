# Conversation Studio: Your Tool for Dynamic Conversation Remixing and Analysis

Most AI Chat applications are sructured like
[instant messaging applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging) where a *user* has a linear conversation with a single *assistant*.

Conversation Studio allows you to step back and manage multiple conversations at once. It's structured like a [forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) with multiple threads and nested replies.

Use conversation studio to earrange, remix, and re-edit your conversations as to elicit different insights and responses form your models.


## Key Features

- **Dynamic Thread Rearrangement:**  
  Drag and drop entire conversation threads or individual messages to form new narratives. Group related content together to create a more meaningful flow.

- **Color-Coded Nesting:**  
  Each level of the conversation hierarchy is visually distinguished by a unique color. For example, top-level threads might appear in **blue**, direct replies in **green**, and deeper nested responses in **yellow**. This visual cue makes it easy to navigate even the most complex discussions at a glance.

- **Import & Export:**  
  Bring in your conversation data from multiple formats (text, JSON, XML) and export your refined sets when youâ€™re done. Perfect for sharing with colleagues, backing up progress, or preparing input for language models.

- **Local Storage:**  
  Your data stays accessible, even offline. **Conversation Studio** stores your edited conversations locally, ensuring quick access without the need for constant server calls.

- **Connect to AI:**  
  Feed conversations directly into AI models, either through an Open-AI compatible API, or through the Chrome's built-in experimental `window.ai` API.

## Requirements

- A modern browser, preferably **Google Chrome**, with experimental features enabled.
- The Chrome `window.ai` API enabled and configured.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository**  
  `git clone github.com/johnhenry/conversation-studio.git`
1. **Move into the Project Directory**
  `cd conversation-studio`
1. **Install Dependencies**  
  `npm install`
1. **Start the App**  
  `npm run dev`
1. **Open the App in a Browser**  
  `http://localhost:5173`


## Using AI

By default, AI feaures are disable.
To enable AI Generation features,
open the settings panel and in the AI section
select your chosen `AI Type`.

### OpenAI

You can use any OpenAI-compatible API.
By default, we point to the local URL used by [ollama](https://ollama.com).

### Windows.ai

The window.ai API is very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.
It's tricky to install, and even if you get it installed, it's prone to breakage.

The developer of [page assist](https://github.com/n4ze3m/page-assist) posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxKXcMgiz5k&ab_channel=HappyComputingwithDennis), whic should help you get it installed.

## Known Issues

### Importing

- Importing JSON -- works once, but not subsequently until a page is reloaded.
- Importing XML -- doese not work
- Importing Text -- does not work

### Mobile Support (local network hosting)

- Control is a bit clunky on mobile
- Cannot seem to get AI features to work on mobile via local OpenAI API

## Roadmap

### Importing

When it works, importing currently replaces existing data, we should have some sort of merging algorithm.

### Anti-Social Network Integratioins

This was originally imagined as an interface for the [AntiSocial Network](https://github.com/johnhenry/antisocial-network) project. We will bring this full circle.

### Store as PGLite

### Connect to external FS/DB
